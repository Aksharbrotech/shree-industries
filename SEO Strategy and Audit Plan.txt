SEO Architecture Strategy: Shree Industries

Prepared by: Senior SEO Architect
Date: October 2023
Focus: Local Ranking (Anand, Gujarat) & Industrial Keywords

1. Technical SEO Checklist (Implemented in index.html)

A. Core Web Vitals Optimization

LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):

Strategy: The Hero image is properly sized (object-cover) and we are using preconnect for the image CDN (Unsplash) to speed up the handshake.

Code: <link rel="preconnect" href="https://images.unsplash.com">

CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):

Strategy: Explicit width and height attributes added to all <img> tags. This reserves the screen space before the image loads, preventing content jumping.

Mobile-First Indexing:

Strategy: Viewport meta tag is standard. Touch targets (buttons) are sized >48px for finger taps. Font sizes are legible (base 16px).

B. Schema Markup (JSON-LD)

We have implemented a Nested JSON-LD structure.

ManufacturingBusiness: More specific than just "LocalBusiness".

geo: Latitude/Longitude provided for Anand GIDC to help Google Maps ranking.

priceRange: $$ (Standard indicator).

founder: explicitly named "Dhruv Patel" to build E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness).

Content Rules Applied:

H1: One per page. Contains the primary keyword.

H2: Used for sub-topics (e.g., "Our Manufacturing Capabilities").

Alt Text: All images have descriptive alt text (e.g., "Hard Anodising Aluminum Parts" instead of "image1.jpg").

Internal Linking: Footer contains direct links to specific services (#anodising, #machining) to distribute link equity.

3. Local SEO Strategy (Anand, Gujarat)

NAP Consistency:

Name: Shree Industries

Address: GIDC Industrial Estate, Anand, Gujarat

Phone: +91 98765 43210

Action: Ensure this EXACT format is used on Google Business Profile, Facebook, and JustDial.

Google Map Embed:

The index.html includes a placeholder for an embedded Google Map.

Action: Generate an iframe from the Google Business Profile and replace the placeholder image in the "About" section.

4. Performance & Production Recommendations

The provided index.html uses Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid prototyping and preview accuracy. For the Production Live Site, perform the following:

Remove CDN: Install Tailwind via NPM.

PurgeCSS: Configure tailwind.config.js to tree-shake unused CSS.

Minify: Minify HTML, CSS, and JS files.

Image Formats: Convert all JPG/PNG images to WebP or AVIF for 30% smaller file sizes.

Example: <picture><source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="image.jpg"></picture>

Caching: Configure .htaccess or Nginx to set Cache-Control: max-age=31536000 for static assets.

5. E-E-A-T Signals (Trust Factors)

Google evaluates content based on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.

Experience: We added "Est. 2014" and "12+ Years Experience".

Expertise: We listed specific technical specs (e.g., "+/- 0.01mm Accuracy", "Type III Anodising").

Trust: Physical address, Indian phone number, and specific founder name are prominent.

This architecture creates a solid foundation for ranking on Page 1 for terms like "Hard Anodising Anand" and "CNC Job Work Gujarat".
